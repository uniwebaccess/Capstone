# Uniweb Access

**A web application that, given a URL, scans the webpage and returns feedback about its accessibility.**

Uniweb Access is developed by Ksenia Rozhdestvenskaya, Khrystyna Tsiupa, Elizabeth Howell, and Elijah Meshnick.

Our aim is to provide a tool for web developers to assess the inclusivity and accessibility of their sites to a wide variety of users, including those with disabilities. We base our assessments on the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and the checklist created by the [A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/).

## Tech Stack

- Javascript
- React
- Puppeteer
- Chart.js
- Redux

Our backend was created with Node.js, Firebase, Express, and deployed on Heroku.

## Current Features

- Users can input a URL for our application to test

- Uniweb Access will run a series of tests on the requested site and calculate scores based on the site's accessibility

- In addition to individual test scores, we offer visual representations of your result data and a comparison to the average score of all sites we have previously tested

## Additional Ideas

- Allow users to create an account and save their scan results to reference later

- Integrate Google Lighthouse for more comprehensive results
